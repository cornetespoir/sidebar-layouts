# sidebar-layouts
Easy and customizable layouts for themes.

How to install:

Step 1:
Copy the code in styles.css

Step 2: 
Paste it in your theme before </style>

Step 3:
Add the "layout" class to your theme's container, "layout-sidebar" to the sidebar, and "layout-section" to the container for your posts.

Make sure your code follows this structure in order for it to work:

<div class="layout">

<div class="layout-sidebar">
<!-- sidebar content goes here -->
</div>

<div class="layout-section">
  <!-- posts go here -->
</div>
